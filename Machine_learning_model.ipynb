        "### ⚙️ **Key Points of the Code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧱 **Step 1 – Libraries**: Imported essential libraries like `pandas` for data handling, `scikit-learn` for model building and preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 📥 **Step 2 – Load Data**: Read the dataset `crop_cleaned.xlsx` using `pandas`.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧹 **Step 3 – Clean Data**: Removed the `Crop_Year` column, assuming it was not useful for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🎯 **Step 4 – Features/Target**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `X` = all input features (columns except `Yield`)\n",
        "  * `y` = the target variable `Yield`\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧩 **Step 5 – Column Types**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `categorical_features`: Crop, Season, State\n",
        "  * `numerical_features`: Area, Production, Annual Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🛠 **Step 6 – Preprocessing**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Numerical**: Scaled using `StandardScaler`\n",
        "  * **Categorical**: Encoded using `OneHotEncoder`\n",
        "  * Combined using `ColumnTransformer`\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🔀 **Step 7 – Data Split**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Split into **80% training** and **20% testing** using `train_test_split`.\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🤖 **Step 8 – Model Training**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Built a **Pipeline**: preprocessing + `RandomForestRegressor`\n",
        "  * Trained the model using training data\n",
        "\n",
        "* 📊 **Step 9 – Model Testing**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Made predictions on test data\n",
        "  * Calculated **R² Score**: reflects how well the model predicts; closer to 1 is better\n",
        "  * Printed output like: `R2 Score on test set: **0.86**` (example)\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🧪 **Step 10 – Input New Data**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Created a new DataFrame with fresh values (e.g., for Maize in Karnataka)\n",
        "\n",
        "* 📈 **Step 11 – Predict Yield**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Used the model to predict yield for the new input\n",
        "  * Printed output like: `Predicted Yield: **2465.23**` (example)\n",
